- It is a version control system which tracks the changes in a file and helps in coordinating with multiple people. it can be used for any kind of file
and it fits the need of software development of tracking multiple changes in the project's code.
- It is based on tree model graphs (merkle tree),mostly written in c for its speed and portability.
- It is a shell comand line based system which requires us to remember the various commands. There are numerous commands and users are required to 
memorise them based on their usage.

      Random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
      Stupid. Contemptible and despicable. Simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
      "Global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
      "Goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.

- git runs locally on your computer, it's files and histories are stored locally on your computer. repository contains all the project files and their histories
this creates a subfolder of metadata for tracking changes.
