## Assignment 1.A :  
Without using numpy (inbuilt function) write a python function to do matrix multiplication, matrix addition and calculating matrix inverse (use for loops). 
And then you can check your result by comparing to the values calculated by using the numpy inbuilt functions.

### Instructions -
1. Make sure to include your submission in the correct folder [Instructions here](https://github.com/sandeepb20/Project2022/blob/main/Applications_Of_Reinforcement_Learning/README.md)
2. Also print the time taken by your function using the time library.
3. You can give a matrix as input, but I would suggest you to generate the matrix using random function.
