# Assignment 1


### Problems Covered in Assign1 :
1. Addition Of Two Matrix With or Without NumPy
2. Multiplication Of Two Matrix With or Without NumPy
3. Inverse Of Matrix With or Without NumPy
4. Time Taken To Execute Above Codes


### Learning Of NumPy Library :
1. For Multiplication Of Two Matrix --> np.dot(A, B)
2. For Addition Of Two Matrix --> np.add(A, B)
3. For Inverse Of Matrix --> np.linalg.inv(A)
4. For Random Matrix --> np.random.randint((m*n+1), size=(m, n))


### Time Library :
import time <br />
a = time.time() <br />
*write your code here* <br />
b = time.time() <br />
print(b-a) <br />
