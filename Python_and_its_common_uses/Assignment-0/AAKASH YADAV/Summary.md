# A brief introduction about Git


# 1. GIT
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

* Git helps out a lot with respect to incremental code development and documentation.
* Git is relatively easy to pick up and learn.
* Git is very efficient and will not adversely affect your code.
* If you make a mistake with your code, Git can easily revert you back to a working version of your code.
* You can easily maintain multiple backups of your code that can update themselves without you needing to copy/paste your code over.
* You can review the history of your code.
* You can make multiple versions of your code.
* You can work on experimental changes or features without breaking your working code.
* You can keep track of contributions to the code when working as part of a team.
* Companies use version control, so you will need to learn version control eventually.


# 2. GITHUB

* GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.
* GitHub makes tools that use Git.
* Github allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers
* GitHub also allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans.
*  In Github repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
