# Short Summary on Git And GitHub

## Git
*Git is a **DevOps** (Development And Operations) tool used for source code management.*\
It is a **free and open-source version control system** used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.\
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.\
With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.


## GitHub
*GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.*\
Itâ€™s **free, easy to use,** and has become central in the movement toward **open-source software**.\
It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. \
GitHub also serves as a social networking site in which developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.


## GitHub Cloning 
*Cloning is a process of creating a copy of code that is actually presented in your repository. Once cloning is done then you are able to do changes in your created copy of code and whenever you want you may able to pull all changes to your repository.*


## GitHub Pull Requests
*A pull request in GitHub is a request to the maintainer of a repository to pull in some code. When you write some code that you want to contribute to a repository, you create and submit a pull request.*
